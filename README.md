# AIGC_model_analysis

In order to better understand different AIGC related models like stable diffusion, we use this repo to analyze them.


 
1. [stable diffusion cross attention analysis](https://github.com/cloudwishper/AIGC_model_analysis/tree/main/stable_diffusion_cross_attention)

    Prompt-to-prompt ICLR 2023 is a good paper to help us understand how the word token control the internal attention map and then it controls the generated images.
